2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Raw data was cleaned and transformed using Power BI's Power Query. This included handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and creating calculated columns for deeper analysis.

3. **Sales Performance Overview:** The dashboard provides a high-level view of key sales metrics, including total revenue, number of units sold, average order value, and growth rates over different periods.

4. **Sales by Region:** A visual breakdown of sales performance by geographic regions, highlighting top-performing areas and identifying regions that need attention.

5. **Product Analysis:** Detailed analysis of sales by product categories and individual products. This includes insights into best-selling products, inventory turnover, and profit margins.

6. **Customer Segmentation:** The dashboard segments customers based on sales data, enabling the identification of high-value customers and analyzing buying patterns.

7. **Time Series Analysis:** Sales trends over time are visualized to identify seasonal patterns, peak sales periods, and long-term growth trends.

8. **Interactive Visualizations:** The dashboard includes various interactive visualizations like bar charts, line charts, heat maps, and pie charts. Users can filter and drill down into specific data points for more detailed analysis.

9. **KPIs and Targets:** Key performance indicators (KPIs) are tracked against targets, with conditional formatting to highlight performance gaps.
